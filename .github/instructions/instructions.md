# Copilot Instructions for .NET/C# Projects

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for using GitHub Copilot in .NET/C# projects. Copilot can assist with code generation, refactoring, documentation, and more. Follow these steps to maximize productivity and ensure best practices.

## 1. Setting Up Copilot

- Ensure you have the GitHub Copilot extension installed in Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio.
- Sign in with your GitHub account to activate Copilot.
- For Visual Studio Code, use the Extensions sidebar to search for "GitHub Copilot" and install.

## 2. Using Copilot in .NET/C# Projects

- Copilot works with C# files (.cs), project files (.csproj), and solution files (.sln).
- Start typing code, comments, or documentation. Copilot will suggest completions and code snippets.
- Accept suggestions with `Tab` or cycle through alternatives with `Ctrl` + `[`/`]`.

### Example Prompts
- `// Create a method to fetch data from an API`
- `// Implement a unit test for the Calculator class`
- `/// <summary>Generate a LINQ query to filter users by age</summary>`

## 3. Best Practices

- Write clear comments and method summaries to guide Copilot.
- Use region tags and XML documentation for better context.
- Review Copilot's suggestions for correctness and security.
- Refactor generated code as needed to match project standards.

---

## 4. Troubleshooting

- If Copilot is not suggesting code, check your internet connection and GitHub authentication.
- Ensure your project is recognized as a .NET/C# project (presence of .csproj/.sln files).
- Restart the IDE if suggestions stop appearing.
